Welcome to NEMU!
For help, type "help"
invalid opcode(eip = 0x001000c9): 99 f7 ff 89 c8 0f af c1 ...

There are two cases which will trigger this unexpected exception:
1. The instruction at eip = 0x001000c9 is not implemented.
2. Something is implemented incorrectly.
Find this eip(0x001000c9) in the disassembling result to distinguish which case it is.

[1;31mIf it is the first case, see

If it is the second case, remember:
* The machine is always right!
* Every line of untested code is always wrong![0m
